												<h3>Tiled Map Editor</h3>
											</header>
											<p>All levels were made using the free level editor called Tiled. With intergration set up by the programming team, level designers were able to easily create and efficiently iterate on levels built using square tiles. By cleverly utilizing parallax, layers, and transparency, we were able to create interesting gameplay and pleasing visuals.</p>

										</div>
										<p><strong>Chaddius Maximus</strong> is a 2D Platformer Metroidvania where you take control of the big-muscled hero Chaddius, who must save his kingdom from a spreading corruption. With responsive movement and a throwable spear, players must traverse the ruins of the castle and fight the monsters that reside within.</p>
										<p>My biggest contributions to this project were the forest levels at the beginning and in the middle of the game. The first few levels were meant for onboarding and introducing the different enemy types, whereas the other levels, nearing the end of the game, introduced the Spear Throw ability and its functions. The video above shows the levels I worked on.</p>
										<p>Chaddius Maximus was created using the Coyote Engine, a custom made engine by a team of programmers in 16 weeks. In those last 8 weeks, the team was reformed and development for Chaddius Maximus started. Before that, while the engine was being developed, I was working on the <a href="#">Skaturion project</a>.</p>
										<p><strong>What went right?</strong><br>
										For a game created from scratch with a custom made engine in 8 weeks, the result is something I'm proud to have been part of. Through simple but efficient design of the enemies and the combat, in combination with clever and creative level design, we were able to create a short but fun and engaging platforming game. The levels were consistent in its challenges and gameplay and were balanced well to increase the difficulty gradually. Together with the beautiful pixel art created by the art team, the environment, enemies, and of course Chaddius himself all have character and charm.</p>
										<p><strong>What went wrong?</strong><br>
										For the first half of the project, we were very unsure where the qualities of the game would lie. It took us a long time to find a unique selling point, which is noticeable in the end product. While the subtle and simple design does work well, it wasn't fully intentional. We didn't prioritize playtesting and balancing enough, resulting in some elements not being rationally designed. We also had some issues regarding scope, resulting in the last few levels, in which the player would have to fully master their Spear Throw ability, being cut.</p>
