												<h3>The Iterations</h3>
											</header>
											<p>It took 7 distinct iterations to get to the final whitebox of the level. The changes made in these versions were based on the results of playtesting and collecting feedback constantly. Each iteration tackled one or more areas, either polishing them or scrapping and rebuilding them from scratch. In the video above you can see how the level transformed over time.</p>

										</div>
										<p><strong>Plateau of Leng</strong> is a whitebox FFA DeathMatch level made for Unreal Tournament. Inspired by the cosmic horror stories of H.P. Lovecraft, this level features a small piece of land ripped from our world and placed in another, with the centerpiece being a church torn apart by tentacles from the sea.</p>
										<p>Developed over the course of 8 weeks, this DeathMatch stage checks all the required boxes: a smooth, consistent, and dynamic flow through all the distinct areas, each built around a specific weapon and with at least 3 entry/exit points and enough secondary paths and "ninja paths".</p>
										<p>Made for a school project in Year 2, Block A, this was the first project where I did level design full-time, whereas in previous projects I was primarily a technical designer and working with Blueprints in Unreal Engine, and occasionally doing level design whenever I could. However, it was during this block that I truly discovered my passion for level design and made the choice to specialize in the role.</p>
										<p><strong>What went right?</strong><br>
										The level was chosen out of approximately 40 other levels as one of the nine best levels of the year and became open for an art pass because of both its strong, memorable theme and balanced, well-flowing gameplay. Through constant playtesting, iterating, and not being hesitant to scrap or redo work, Plateau of Leng slowly transitioned from a rough, barely playable blockout to an arena that was fast-paced, chaotic, but most of all, fun.</p>
										<p><strong>What went wrong?</strong><br>
										When building my level, I didn't take the art pass into account and made my level to complicated. As a result, the level did not get chosen. A small group of artists showed interest, but they were merged with one of the other three teams because the task of giving this level an art pass was too big. From this, I learned to design my levels with environment art in mind: clean geometry, reusable/modular assets, a fitting scope, etc.</p>

									<h3>Architecture Research</h3>

								<p>To incorporate the theme of 18th century Lovecraft better, I did additional research into architecture styles and formatted the results as easy to read one-pagers.<br><br><a href="documents/Leng-ArchitectureResearch.pdf">Click here to download</a></p>
